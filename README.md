# cscan / Automated Penetration Tester

Automated Penetration Tester will be a tool that uses the cscan as a basis of integration with [Faraday](https://www.faradaysec.com/). It will ease the process of performing a pentest for pentesters while also providing support to developers and sys admins who are not necessarily security inclined.
